# Meerkat ASL

**Meerkat ASL** is a project aimed at building an American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Features

- **ASL Recognition**: The system can recognize American Sign Language gestures in real-time using computer vision.
- **Capture Mode**: Allows users to capture images of ASL gestures for training and testing purposes.
- **Testing Mode**: Enables users to test the ASL recognition system by inputting ASL gestures and receiving predictions.
- **Training Mode**: Trains the machine learning model using captured ASL gesture data.

## Getting Started

To get started with Meerkat ASL, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `Meerkat_Main.py` to launch the application.

## Usage

1. **ASL Mode**: Launches the application in ASL recognition mode, where the system recognizes ASL gestures in real-time.
2. **Capture Mode**: Allows users to capture images of ASL gestures for training and testing purposes.
3. **Testing Mode**: Enables users to test the ASL recognition system by inputting ASL gestures and receiving predictions.
4. **Training Mode**: Trains the machine learning model using captured ASL gesture data.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
